honourable senators , what happened here , last Tuesday ? 
a selection committee was achievement . 
yesterday I attended the first to meeting of this committee . 
and I expected the committee admits that it does too knew what to do with the independent senators . 
what will not so concern for the time . 
the members of the selection committee can show some impact . 
on the business that a senator reshape over the next two years . 
it is a committee , important because , in principle , these nine senators to determine what sit committee some senators . 
my therefore introduced in the sitting of the committee to yesterday to realize that one of the nine not attend senators . 
it was sent a replacement . 
honourable senators , I do name person . 
you now to see how friendly , i am ' t it ? 
the senators will have their own to find research who was on fault . 
when an individual accepts an work , it must do the . 
the women who are sitting in the Senate have proven . 
they remplissaient their duty much more that the majority of the men in the Senate . 
i remember as the sessions held that the committee to the of veterans in February 1998 . 
the Senate Ni or the House of Commons do not sitting at the time . 
three senators saw Liberals to proceedings of the committee , all of women . 
the officers of the Senate could not find a man to this committee . 
i could cite , word about what the senator Carstairs took answered the question I asked . word was said , hon. 
i asked him : " Quels were the criteria are as follows ? " 
it has said that it was the first to address the representation of women in a report . 
that it had on the drafted parliamentary associations in 1993 . 
delegations Les at the time formées were only of men . 
in that I remind that I have been replaced by Senator Finestone for a number of years . 
however , I still look the opportunity to re - enter preferred my association . 
honourable senators , I do not know how or when the House will be ruling in regard to these two reports . 
every time that the verdict are senators on television . 
wondered or by a group of students , or any of journalists . 
say that we do ? 
it is true , and I will believe . 
however , it should be bring in fact . 
i do not believe in the replacing . 
if a senator accept this position in a committee , he should participate or it to all the provided meetings . 
we are not the members of which we say in the corridors : 
" you - to committee and today , after two years of there is a vote in committee final '' . schooling , Présentez 
they do not even know what they are viewed , but they came to sang when their leaders sang to them . 
they do not know absolutely what has happened . 
honourable the words " continuité " and " dedication to the in our . speech way are '' senators , 
over the next two weeks , beginning to reflect on the way we will address the situation of the independent senators . 
if we are not do the , I my own of parliamentarians interested in the is who committee créerai world affairs . 
no one can we are gained .
